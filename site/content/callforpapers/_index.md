# How Digitalization Impacts Software Business
Conference theme: How Digitalization Impacts Software Business

Although the business of software shares common features with other international knowledge-intensive businesses, it carries many inherently unique features. It is making it a challenging domain for research. The examples of many successful companies show that software provides a unique benefit to its users. Moreover, software has spread all over the world and has permeated in many industries, which are not usual for software. In particular, software companies have to depend on one another to deliver a unique value proposition to their customers or a unique experience to their users. Companies that were engineering-driven become software intensive and struggle to keep up with the required speed of development and planning.

ICSOB 2018 intends to attract researchers and practitioners who are concerned with software business in different ways. You are invited to submit papers addressing contemporary issues emerging at the intersection of the software and business domains, broadly defined. Both papers reporting research results and industrial experiences are welcome.

We welcome both research and industry papers to the conference. The papers should be original and not submitted to or accepted by any other conference or journal. We are looking for short position and practice papers (maximum 6 pages) that provide insights on the life cycle management of software products and industry case studies as well as full research papers (maximum 15 pages) describing novel approaches to software business for software products and services.

The topics that ICSOB welcomes (but not limited to) are listed below:

* Software Ecosystems and App Stores – aspects related to software ecosystems health, ecosystem orchestration and governance, app economy, actors and supply network analysis, incentives and ecosystem-based business models
* Software Business Development – aspects related to developing business models and business modeling for software products and services, economics of software companies, internationalization, outsourcing and other strategies for realizing these business models.
* Licensing, intellectual property and patents aspects and other legal aspects associated with software business – privacy and security is also welcome here.
* Software startups – aspects related to environment success factors for software business and startups, software startup processes, disruptive innovation and adoption of startups, managing startup growth and research dissemination through startups
* Continuous Improvement – aspects related to continuous and holistic approach to software business that include software product management, lifecycle perspective, effective business model change and improvement, continuous delivery and agile development to support software businesses. Also platform governance, digital platforms and matchmakers, value co-creation, mergers and acquisitions.
* Other aspect- games and gamification, software business education, disruptive trends in software business and the future of software business
